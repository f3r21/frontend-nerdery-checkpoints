 * Server state and UI state are kept apart on purpose: the fetched users are

 * UI state in a context.
 *
 * Created once at module scope, not per AppStateProvider mount: the whole
 * point of caching is that it survives a consumer unmounting and
 * remounting - including the provider itself remounting when this demo's
 * route is navigated away from and back to. A queryClient created inside
 * the component (e.g. via `useState`) would throw the cache away on exactly
 * that navigation, which defeats the "reused across navigation" contract.
